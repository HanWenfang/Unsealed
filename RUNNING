Unsealed: Whispers of Wisdom

The easiest way to run this project, you need to clone the git repository to a 
local folder or download the entire project's source.

After downloading it, open Eclipse and import both Unsealed and Unsealed-android.

Unsealed contains all the game's logic, as well as the DesktopLauncher.
Unsealed-android is an empty shell that links to Unsealed, and executes on 
Android. You need the Android SDK as well as the Android plugin on Eclipse to
build the application easily for Android. 

To execute, just right click Unsealed (Or Unsealed-android) and click on Run As.
A couple of options should show up, look for the one that says DesktopLauncher,
if you're running the Desktop version, or select Android Application if you're
running the Android version, and launch it to the emulator or device.

The project is in an extremely early alpha, so build at your own risk. 

At this point, I accept no bugs, only bugfixes. 

Share & Enjoy.
